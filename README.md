### 🚀 What I Do
I design and build **end-to-end AI systems** — from training and fine-tuning models to full-stack orchestration with real-time UIs.  
Every project you see here was **planned, coded, and deployed solo**.

- 🧠 **Specialization:** Generative AI, LangGraph multi-agent systems, NLP, and image generation pipelines  
- ⚙️ **Stack:** Groq · FastAPI · LangGraph · LLaMA-3 · BERT · SDXL · Angular · FAISS · Streamlit  
- 🧩 **Philosophy:** learn by doing · debug by obsession · build what no one asks for yet

### 🧩 Featured Projects

**🧾 [Insurance Risk Profiler](#)**  
→ Predicts client risk, premium tier, and churn probability using machine learning classification models.

**🎯 [LeadIntentAI](#)**  
→ Fine-tuned BERT model that classifies sales leads into 8 intent categories and suggests next-step actions.  
→ Hosted on Hugging Face: [`Sanji8421/fine_tuned_BERT`](https://huggingface.co/Sanji8421/fine_tuned_BERT)

**🎨 [Agentic Content Generator](#)**  
→ Full-stack multi-agent GenAI system built with LangGraph, Groq, and A4F.  
→ Automates creative content workflows: planning → prompt generation → image synthesis → captioning.  
→ Dynamic UI built with Angular + FastAPI backend.

### 🛠️ Current Focus
Building **agentic pipelines** that combine reasoning, creativity, and automation —  
making AI that *thinks, plans, and creates* instead of just responding.
